## Troubleshooting Demo Issues

### Ollama Not Found
```
‚ùå Ollama setup failed: Ollama not responding at http://localhost:11434

üí° Troubleshooting:
   üíª Local Environment:
   ‚Ä¢ Check Ollama is running: ollama serve
   ‚Ä¢ Test connection: curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ‚Ä¢ Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai/
```

### Model Doesn't Support Function Calling
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This model may not support function calling
üí° For best results, try: llama3.1:8b, qwen2.5, or other function-calling models

Model responded without function calling capability.
Try: ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### API Token Issues
```
‚ùå API Token: Missing
Run: npm run demo:setup
Edit .env file and add COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN
```

## Container Environment

If running in your containerized environment, the demo will automatically detect this and provide container-specific troubleshooting:

```
üê≥ Running in Docker container
‚úÖ Containerized setup detected

üîß Current Configuration:
   ‚Ä¢ Ollama host: http://ai_ollama:11434
   ‚Ä¢ Environment: Container
   ‚Ä¢ API Token: ‚úÖ Set
```

This ensures the demo works seamlessly in your Docker Swarm environment while remaining flexible for other users' local setups.
